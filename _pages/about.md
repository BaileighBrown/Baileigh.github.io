I am a gradute student at Kennesaw State University getting my master of science degree in software engineering. I received my bachelor of science from Gordon State College in middle grades education. Previously I was apart of Mckenney's IT co-op in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently I am working as a UI Engineer intern at Teradata for the summer of 2024!

### Reap ###

Reap is a contactless payment device I have been working on using NFID and RFC technologies (many versions and still in progress)

In today's society we are quickly moving past the need for physical currencies, but not everyone is able to keep up with such progressions due to one disadvantage or another. I have seen many people on the internet mention how if they could just tap to pay to donate to those who are houseless/homeless then 9 times out of 10 they would. But because they typically don't carry cash on them they can't donate as frequently as they would like to. 

The donor would simply tap the wearers device with their phone. This will bring up a screen to ask for a donation amount. Via the users phone they will input the amount they'd like to donate, transfer and move on. 

As for the product ‘reap’ the idea is for the device to be inconspicuous, accessible and portable. Ease of use. 

### Teradata ###
At Teradata I was able to work on the user interface engineering team. I worked directly on company products, showcasing and demonstrating new implementations to stakeholders, and cultivating relationships with colleagues to work on monthly releases.

### Mckenney's Inc ###
Working at Mckenney's exposed me to the world of IT. During my first rotation I worked predominantly as a helpdesk technician. I resolved over 100 tickets through freshdesk ticketing system and helped support workers across metro Atlanta at 8+ jobsites.
